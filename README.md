# dev-test from no-more

## task:

- Create a HTML page based on the image (in the following slide)
- Apply relevant CSS styles
- may replace the pictures and icons with inputs of your choice
- more than welcome to use bootstrap or any other CSS framework, Boostrap, SCSS, etc.

## notes:
- Since there is no detail on the design, many of the elements are positioned based on eyeballing the template image.
- Only one media query is added, with basic layout change.
- JS is added only for toggle burger menu in mobile version.

## solution 1:

- the set of *index.html* and *style.css* is the solution without any framework/preprocessor involved. Only basic CSS, Grid and custom properties are used.

## solution 2:
- to be added

## OBS.
- both contributor acounts on this repo are mine.
